This SQL data cleaning project involves several steps to clean and standardize a dataset on layoffs. Key steps include removing duplicates, 
standardizing data formats, handling null and blank values, and ultimately ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
The process involves creating staging tables, using common table expressions (CTEs), and updating or deleting problematic entries.
